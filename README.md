# basic-programming-toki

This course is from [TOKI Learning Course]([https://tlx.toki.id/courses/basic](https://tlx.toki.id/courses/basic-cpp)) for Basic Programming. I completed it in the first semester of my computer science studies as a foundation for basic programming concepts for my future studies and work.
